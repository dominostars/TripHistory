# TripHistory
Simple app for recording trips!

## Setup
Download and install! Built using Xcode 6.3 beta 4, though should work with any Xcode 6.x version.

## Features
* Automatic logging of trips
* Background tracking of location updates
* Reverse geocoding of start and end locations
* Enable and disable logging
* **View active trip as it is running**
* **Trip detail map view with route and trip summary. Updates with an active trip**
* **Trips are serialized between run times**
* **Robust location authorization handling** *(What? Isn't this just expected?)*

## Testing
Unit tests built using XCTest. Employed light TDD when building early models, but used it less as time ran out.
